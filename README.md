# adb_converter
A subset of tmk/tmk_keyboard with just the Apple Desktop Bus functionality.

This is the firmware for a pair of circuit boards that I designed and built. To give me ease of isolation from the upstream development, I created this repository with the correct configurations for both boards.

The designs of the boards are not currently available, but may be published if revised to correct substantial errors in the designs.
